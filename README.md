# url2ben
Project to convert url to bookmark, email and/or notes

Project is going to take any URL or link that a user has and stores it into an app or webapp that will categorize it, tag it, 
give it a read status and to help automatically sort the URL into groups based on scraped information from the link to better 
help the user keep up with the saved urls to later reference when the user wants. When the user revisits the link in the app
the app will be able to help keep track of activity going on. 

This project started May 6th, 2020.
